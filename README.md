Bonsai is building the global operating system for freelance work.The way the world works is changing.

Companies want on-demand talent rather than full time employees. Workers want flexible and independent careers. This is one of the largest socio-economic shifts since the Industrial Revolution.

As part of our construct week for group project in Unit 5 at Masai School, we were given to build the clone of the hellobonsai website.

      >We all learned how a team works and how to efficiently communicate when
      working in a team. Each one of us learned to push our limits and work hard
      each day through all the problems we faced. Also, Each one of us learned
      how to be solution-oriented and try different methods to solve the problem
      rather than being stuck on that problem. Last, I would like to mention
      that all of us did our very best to create this project and we are
      thankful for the guidance and support our mentors provided us.</span
